Classifying Outcomes with Logistic Regression
    deal with qualitative (or categorical) variables
        colors, gender, biological species, political party/affiliation
    some variables can be codified as quantitative or as qualitative
        categorical variables red and green if we are talking about color names
            assigning a class to a given observation known as "classification"
            predicting the correct class for new instances
            learning about the parameters of the model that describe the mapping between classes and features
        the quantitative 650 nm and 510 nm wavelengths.

    Logistic regression and inverse link functions
        solve classification problems
        "inverse" link function
        always returns a value between 0 and 1.
        function compresses the whole real line into the interval [0, 1] -> sigmoid function
            characteristic S-shaped aspect

        logistic model
            begin with a simple case: two classes or instances
                ham-spam, safe-unsafe, cloudy-sunny, healthy-ill, red or green (bear or bull)

                codify these classes (encode States)
                     on coin-flipping problem: head - tail
                define predicted variable 
            Eg: Bernoulli distribution as the likelihood
                expecting values limited interval [0, 1]
            use the inverse link function 
                to put the values returned by the linear model in a range 
                    suitable to the Bernoulli distribution
            transforming a linear regression model into a classification model

            The iris dataset
                containing "information" about the flowers of 3 species: setosa, virginica, and versicolor 
                    sepal_length | sepal_width | petal_length | petal_width ~ dependent variables
                pairplot.

            applied model
                2 classes + just one independent variable or feature
                encode the categorical variables

                deterministic variables     
                    theta is the result of applying the logistic function to the variable mu
                        S-shaped line is the mean value of theta
                        probability of a flower being "versicolor or setosa" by known "sepal length"
                        95% HPD interval band 
                        boundary decision is a scalar make sense with "unidimensional" data

                    bd is the boundary decision, the value used to separate between classes
                    called the Theano function sigmoid
                    

                figure shows the sepal length versus the flower species
