Mixture Models
    One common approach to model building is about combining or "mixing" simpler models to obtain more "complex" ones
    directly modeling subpopulations or as a useful trick 
        to handle complicated distributions that cannot be described with simpler distributions
    Sometimes a process or phenomenon under study cannot be properly described using a single distribution
    data comes from a mixture of distributions are know as mixture models

    
Finite mixture models
Zero-Inflated Poisson distribution
Zero-Inflated Poisson regression
Robust logistic regression
Model-based clustering
Continuous mixture models
