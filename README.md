## 1. Thinking Probabilistically - A Bayesian Inference Primer
This chapter serves as an introduction to thinking in probabilistic terms, laying down the foundational concepts of Bayesian inference. You'll grasp the core principles behind Bayesian statistics, understanding how to update beliefs with new evidence. Exploring real-world examples, it illustrates how Bayesian thinking differs from frequentist approaches, highlighting the advantages of this method.

## 2. Programming Probabilistically – A PyMC3 Primer
Here, we delve into the practical aspect of Bayesian analysis with Python, focusing on PyMC3. You'll learn to implement Bayesian models using PyMC3, a powerful probabilistic programming library. This chapter covers the basics of model specification, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and posterior analysis. By the end, you'll be equipped to construct your own Bayesian models and analyze their results.

## 3. Juggling with Multi-Parametric and Hierarchical Models
Moving beyond single-parameter models, this chapter explores the complexity of multi-parametric and hierarchical models. You'll understand how to handle models with multiple parameters, incorporating dependencies and hierarchies. Practical examples demonstrate how to implement these models in PyMC3, providing a comprehensive understanding of their applications and nuances.

## 4. Understanding and Predicting Data with Linear Regression Models
Linear regression is a fundamental tool for data analysis and prediction. In this chapter, we explore Bayesian linear regression, which offers advantages over traditional methods. You'll learn to build Bayesian linear regression models using PyMC3, enabling you to make more robust predictions and quantify uncertainty in your results.

## 5. Classifying Outcomes with Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is essential for binary classification tasks, such as predicting outcomes with two possible categories. This chapter introduces Bayesian logistic regression, demonstrating its superiority in handling uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge. Through practical examples, you'll gain proficiency in building and interpreting Bayesian logistic regression models.

## 6. Model Comparison
Comparing models is crucial for selecting the most suitable one for your data. Here, we explore Bayesian model comparison techniques, such as Bayes factors and Information Criteria. You'll learn how to evaluate the relative performance of different models, aiding in decision-making and model selection.

## 7. Mixture Models
Mixture models are valuable for capturing hidden structures within data, such as identifying clusters or subpopulations. This chapter delves into Bayesian mixture models, showing how to model complex data distributions. Through PyMC3 implementations, you'll discover how to apply mixture models for tasks like clustering and density estimation.

## 8. Gaussian Processes
Gaussian processes provide a flexible framework for modeling complex relationships in data. This chapter introduces Bayesian Gaussian processes, which excel in tasks like regression, classification, and uncertainty quantification. You'll learn to implement Gaussian processes in PyMC3, gaining insights into their use for interpolation, extrapolation, and nonlinear modeling tasks.
